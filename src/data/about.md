# Intro

I am a Full Stack Developer with a deep interest in building scalable web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I have experience working on various projects, including a social media app, a real-time chat application, and an online judge platform for coding competitions. I also enjoy participating in hackathons, such as JP Morgan's "Code for Good" and the Smart India Hackathon, where my team has successfully developed impactful solutions. I'm always eager to learn more about emerging technologies like DevOps and OpenStack.

In my free time, I love problem-solving in competitive programming and exploring new tech stacks. If you believe I can contribute to your project or have an interesting problem to discuss, feel free to reach out!
