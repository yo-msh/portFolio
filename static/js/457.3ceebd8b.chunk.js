Our team was tasked with building a platform to empower underprivileged girls. We developed the platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), ensuring scalability and ease of use. The platform featured tutorials, coding guides, and videos to help girls develop their technical skills. We integrated a mentorship program, allowing the girls to connect with tech professionals for guidance. A real-time chat system using Socket.io was built for collaboration. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) were used for secure authentication, ensuring the safety and privacy of users. The platform helped increase the NGO's engagement by 40%, positively impacting the confidence and skills of young girls."})]}),(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"hackathon-details",children:[(0,i.jsx)("h3",{children:"Smart India Hackathon (SIH)"}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"Participated in the Smart India Hackathon, focusing on building a sign language-to-English/Gujarati converter app for the deaf and mute community. We developed the app using a machine learning model trained on sign gestures to convert them into real-time text. Built using React Native, the app ensured cross-platform compatibility. It supported multiple languages and allowed users to create custom gestures for emojis and frequently used symbols. The solution bridged the communication gap for the deaf and mute community, receiving positive feedback. Future development includes scaling the app for more languages and real-time accuracy improvements, with discussions for government support."})]})]})]})})}}]);
